## About The Project

This repository aims to be an automated solution for your Palworld server. You can design your own plug-ins and schedules as you like.

## Built With

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [mccron](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon)
* [schedule](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

### Prerequisites

Please install the following for your distribution (Windows may work but it is untested):

* latest Python3
* Python3 Virtual Env

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/derkalle4/python3-palworld-rcon.git
```

2. Create virtual environment and install all dependencies

```sh
./create_venv.sh
```

## Usage

If you used the ./create_venv.sh you should use this command to run the app:

```sh
./run_in_venv.sh
```
If you do not use a virtual environment the command will look like this:

```sh
python3 .\app.py
```

## Roadmap

Feel free to contribute following the roadmap

* [ ] use types in every function
* [ ] better source code documentation
* [ ] split to multiple classes to make everything smaller and give a better overview
* [ ] re-implement mccron to avoid using a third-party library for the small percentage we need from it
* [ ] document how to properly use this rcon tool
